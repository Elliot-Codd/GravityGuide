  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Actually, I just remembered! I had Hazel make an orientation
    video for new beta testers. Hazel, that video is done, right?

    <t=36>[Hazel
    Marsh]: Yep! All done!

    <t=38>[Asimov]: Great. I haven''t seen the video
    yet, but I''m sure Hazel has done an excellent job. Alexis, I''m opening another
    door that should lead you to the viewing room. Once you''re there I''ll start
    the video.'
