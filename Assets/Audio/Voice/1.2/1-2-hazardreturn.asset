  subtitles: '[David Hazard]: Alright, got that sorted out.

    <t=84>[Hazel]: Oh
    Haz, you''re back!

    <t=87>[Hazard]: Yeah, I got Lenny''s issue fixed. What''d
    I miss?

    <t=90>[Asimov]: We watched the orientation video that Hazel made
    and it was... something.

    <t=94>[Hazard]: Sounds like she did a great job!

    <t=97>[Asimov]:
    Uhh, sure. We can talk about this more later. Alexis is making good progress
    on the tests though.

    <t=103>[Hazard]: Oh, great! Good work, Alexis. Just
    go on through the next door after this test, and we''ll continue.'
