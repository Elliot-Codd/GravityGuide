  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Good work. By the way, that blue thing up ahead is a disintegration
    field. It''s there to keep you from bringing any crates with you between tests.
    Don''t worry, it''s perfectly safe. It''s targeted toward crates only, and we
    only have one recorded dismemberment incident. Just go right on through toward
    the next test.'
