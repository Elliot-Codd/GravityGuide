  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Good, you *can* hear us.

    [Asimov]: Alright Hazard, get
    back to the onboarding.

    <t=52>[Hazard]: Thank you Doctor. Alexis, welcome
    to Gravitonix Industries. We''re thrilled that you''ve signed up to be a beta
    tester for us. You''re going to be able to experience the cutting edge of technology
    here. We''re a bit understaffed today since it''s the weekend, but we shouldn''t
    have any problems with a little beta testing.

    <t=70>[Hazard]: Before we
    get started, I need to go over your personal details with you, just to make sure
    we don''t have any errors in our paperwork. So, your name is Alexis Ward, born
    July 27, 1999. You live at 512 College Drive, Apartment 314. You listed your
    current occupation as "student". Is that all correct?

    <t=92>[Asimov]: Haz,
    she still doesn''t have a microphone. She can''t answer.

    <t=96>[Hazard]:
    Well, I''m sure that''s all fine then.

    <t=99>[Hazard]: Alright then Alexis,
    now that we know who you are, I suppose we should introduce ourselves. My name
    is David Hazard, and I''m the lead researcher here at Gravitonix. I''m responsible
    for everything we''ve got going on down here. Dr. Asimov?

    <t=113>[Asimov]:
    Hello Alexis, my name is Dr. Nicolette Asimov. I''m the technology director,
    and assistant to Hazard. I''m in charge of all the cutting edge tech we''ve got
    down here, and I''m here to deal with it if something ever goes wrong.

    [Asimov]:
    Hazel, you''re up.

    <t=125>[Hazel]: Oh! I didn''t realize I was going to
    get introduced. Hi Alexis! I''m Hazel Marsh. I''m the intern here. I basically
    just do whatever Haz and Dr. Asimov tell me to. This is my first time sitting
    in on the beta testing, so I''m really excited. Good luck!

    <t=139>[Hazard]:
    Great, now that we all know each other, I''m going to tell you a bit about that
    pod you''re sitting in. This is the Gravipod Mk III. It''s the result of our
    latest research into the nature of the universe itself. Now, I''ll explain more
    about what it can do later, but for now let''s get you used to moving around
    in it.

    <t=156>[Hazard]: Now, on the right side of the room, you should see
    a sensor on the wall. Get close to the sensor and press E on your keyboard to
    activate it.
