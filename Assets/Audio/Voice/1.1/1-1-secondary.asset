  subtitles: '[Hazard]: Alright, good. It seems like you''ve got a pretty good grip
    on the primary gravitational manipulator. In this next room, I''m going to disable
    your primary manipulator, and enable your secondary manipulator. The secondary
    manipulator only affects objects around you, but doesn''t affect your pod.

    <t=247>[Hazard]:
    You can activate the secondary manipulator by holding RIGHT CLICK. Get a crate
    into each of the sensors in order to open the door.'
