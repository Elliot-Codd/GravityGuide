  subtitles: '[David Hazard]: (clears throat) Alright. Testing, testing. Are we on?

    <t=8>[Dr.
    Asimov]: Audio is live.

    <t=10>[Hazard]: Good, good.

    <t=13>[Hazard]:
    Ok, Alexis? Can you hear me in there?

    [Hazard]: Alexis? Can you hear me?

    <t=19>[Hazard]:
    Dr. Asimov, what''s wrong? Why isn''t she responding?

    <t=24>[Asimov]: Haz,
    we haven''t installed the onboard microphone yet.

    <t=28>[Hazard]: Oh. Yeah,
    that would explain it. Uh... what do we do now?

    <t=37>[Asimov]: Ok, Alexis.
    I''m going to enable the movement controls on your pod. You can control it using
    the WASD keys on the keyboard in front of you. Please drive to the left side
    of the room to show us you can hear the intercom.
