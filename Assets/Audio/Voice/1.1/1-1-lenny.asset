  subtitles: '[Hazard]: Alright, I just got off the phone with Lenny in engineering.
    I asked him about the wiring issue in the door, and he said something about...
    flooding and... deadly radiation I think? Anyway, I need to go down to engineering
    to get that sorted out, but this door should lead you to the next area. Dr. Asimov
    will lead you through the next tests. Good luck!

    <t=322>[Asimov]: Just activate
    the sensor on the wall and go though the door, Alexis.'
