  subtitles: '[Hazard]: Great work, Alexis. Now that you''re acquainted with the
    controls, we can start looking at the cool part of the Gravipod''s abilities.
    The Gravipod comes equipped with gravitational manipulators that can change the
    direction of gravity for you and the objects in your vicinity.

    <t=198>[Hazard]:
    You can hold down the LEFT CLICK on your mouse to engage and aim your manipulator,
    and then release the click to change your gravity in the direction you aim. In
    this next room, you''ll need to use your gravity manipulator to reach the exit.
    Good luck!'
