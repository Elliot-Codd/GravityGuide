  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Ok. Now, I''m going to have you do a bit of a more complex
    test.

    <t=71>[Hazel]: Oh! I remember seeing the blueprint for this one! Alexis,
    you''ll love this, it''s like a fun little puzzle.

    <t=77>[Asimov]: Yes,
    it''s a bit like a maze. Now, the room is full of several SLB''s of both types.
    At the center of the room is a crate. Get that crate to the sensor zone by navigating
    around the barriers to open the door.

    <t=86>[Hazel]: Good luck!
