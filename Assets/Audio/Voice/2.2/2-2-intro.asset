  subtitles: '[David Hazard]: I just got another message from Lenny in engineering.
    He wants me to come look at a "weird crate" apparently. I told him its just a
    crate, and there''s nothing to worry about but he''s pretty insistent I come
    check it out. Dr. Asimov, you''ll have to introduce the new tech yourself, I''m
    gonna go see what has him so worked up.

    <t=19>[Hazel Marsh]: What could
    be so weird about a crate?

    <t=22>[Hazard]: I don''t know, but I''d better
    check it out. Good luck up here.

    <t=26>[Dr. Nicolette Asimov]: Ok, Alexis.
    In these tests, you''re going to be working with Selective Light Barriers, or
    SLB''s. Yeah, I know, another acronym. Anyway these use specially configured
    photon patterns to create a semi-permeable barrier that only blocks  specific
    materials and objects from passing through.

    <t=42>The red one in this first
    test only blocks crates from passing through it. Later on, you''ll see a yellow
    one that crates can go through just fine, but it blocks your pod.

    <t=50>[Hazel]:
    These ones are my favorite piece of tech here. It''s just so cool that they can
    use light to make something solid. Also I just think they''re pretty to look
    at.'
