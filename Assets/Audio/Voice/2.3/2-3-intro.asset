  subtitles: '[Hazel Marsh]: Dr. Asimov, have you heard anything from Haz about that
    weird crate?

    <t=5>[Dr. Nicolette Asimov]: Actually, I just got a message
    from him. He wants me to come down to help. He can''t figure out what''s wrong
    with it or what to do with it.

    <t=11>[Hazel]: What? It''s just a crate!
    What is there to figure out?

    <t=15>[Asimov]: I don''t know! I guess I''d
    better go and take a look. Can you hold the fort here? Just guide Alexis through
    the next few tests until I get back.

    <t=22>[Hazel]: Oh, uh, sure. I guess.

    <t=25>[Asimov]:
    Ok, great. I''ll be back as soon as possible.

    <t=31>[Hazel]: Ok, Alexis.
    Soooo I''m pretty new to the testing. This is my first time working directly
    in the beta testing. I''m not really sure what the next tests are about, so I
    guess just go through them as best you can.'
