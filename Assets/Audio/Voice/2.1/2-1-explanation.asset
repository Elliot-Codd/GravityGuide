  subtitles: '[Hazard]: So, normally, the force of gravity is based on mass and distance.
    The more massive something is, the stronger its gravity is. The closer you are
    to it, the stronger its gravity pulls on you.

    <t=63>Well, our gravity tech
    uses something called quantum entanglement to link the molecules of whatever
    it affects to a location close to a random celestial body. It effectively tricks
    the universe into thinking you''re much closer to something with gravity in a
    different direction, and therefore you experience gravity as if you were there.

    <t=82>So
    when you use your gravity manipulators to go upwards, you''re actually being
    pulled by the gravity of some random star, thousands of lightyears away.

    <t=92>[Hazel]:
    Why does it have to be so far away? Why not just use the moon or something?

    <t=96>[Asimov]:
    Newton''s third law. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. When something
    exerts a force on you, you also exert a force on it.

    <t=104>If we used the
    same object''s gravity every time, we could have an unwanted impact on it''s
    overall trajectory. If we used the moon, for example, there''s a chance we could
    accidentally pull it onto a collision course with the Earth.

    <t=114>We were
    actually so concerned about that even being possible that we hard coded it into
    the algorithm, so that it would only use celestial bodies further away than the
    moon.

    <t=122>[Hazel]: Oh, that doesn''t sound good.

    <t=126>[Hazard]:
    Yeah, some of this tech could have catastrophic effects if misused. It''s a miracle
    that the government doesn''t regulate us at all.'
