  subtitles: '[David Hazard]: Ok, it''s time to show you something new. In this test,
    you''ll be working with Directional Gravity Fields, or DGF''s.

    <t=9>[Hazel
    Marsh]: You might have noticed Hazard has a habit of giving things three letter
    acronyms.

    <t=12>[Hazard]: I do not!

    <t=15>[Hazel]: Haz, a few minutes
    ago you showed her the DMF''s, and now you''re talking about DGF''s. You have
    a problem.

    <t=20>[Hazard]: Well, if you hate my acronyms so much, you can
    just call them Gravity Fields!

    <t=25>[Dr. Nicolette Asimov]: Well regardless
    of the name, anything that enters a Gravity Field while it''s turned on will
    be affected by gravity in the direction of the field until it leaves. I''m sure
    you can figure it out. We''ll check in with you again after you complete this
    next test.'
