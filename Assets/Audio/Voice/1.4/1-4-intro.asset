  subtitles: '[David Hazard]: Ok, Alexis. It seems like you''ve mastered the basics,
    so it''s time to introduce something new. In the next few tests, you''re going
    to see the Gravitronix Distance Modulation Field. We call them DMF''s for short.
    Patent pending. I won''t go into the super technical details, but basically it
    can force an object to always be the same distance from it.

    <t=20>[Dr. Nicolette
    Asimov]: Objects attached to the Distance Modulation Field can still be affected
    by gravity, so you can still move them with your gravity manipulators. Good luck!'
